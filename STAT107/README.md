## STAT107 Data Science Discovery

Data Science Discovery is the intersection of statistics, computation, and real-world relevance.  
As a project-driven course, students perform hands-on-analysis of real-world datasets to analyze and  
discover the impact of the data. Throughout each experience, students reflect on the social issues surrounding  
data analysis such as privacy and design.
