## CS 374 - Intro to Algs & Models of Comp

### https://jeffe.cs.illinois.edu/teaching/algorithms/  

### Course Description:

Analysis of algorithms, major paradigms of algorithm design including recursive algorithms, divide-and-conquer algorithms,  
dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, and graph algorithms. Formal models of computation including finite automata and  
Turing machines. Limitations of computation arising from fundamental notions of algorithm and from complexity-theoretic  
constraints. Reductions, undecidability and NP-completeness.
