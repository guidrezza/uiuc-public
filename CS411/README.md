### Most of this course was completed online, using the UIUC PrairieLearn (PL) platform. A description of the course is listed below. I personally programmed all of the topics below in PL.

### The final project was written using Jupyter Notebooks and JavaScript (Node.js). A copy of the final version of the repository has been pasted here.
