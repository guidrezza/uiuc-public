## [Numerical Methods I](https://courses.engr.illinois.edu/cs357/fa2022/)

### This class was programmed in the internal UIUC platform PrairieLearn (PL). The description of the class and topics are listed below, all of which I personally programmed in PL.

Numerical methods play an increasingly important role in a wide variety of engineering and physical sciences.  
In past decades, to test the efficiency of a new aircraft design, an expensive physical prototype had to be built and flown;  
now, an aerospace engineer can perform this test with an accurate simulation on her laptop.

This course introduces the fundamentals of scientific computing and numerical methods, with theoretical algorithms  
supplemented with hands-on programming exercises. Numerical simulations are only useful when they are accurate and reliable;  
hence we will learn how to understand the error in scientific computing, particularly the effects of representing real numbers  
with a finite amount of memory in the form of floating-point numbers. This is just as important as the understanding  
of the algorithms themselves!
