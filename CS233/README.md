## [CS233](https://cs.illinois.edu/academics/courses/cs233)

### This class was programmed over a virtual machine online, using the UIUC PrairieLearn platform. We used Verilog to program an entire MIPS processor from scratch.

#### Pasted below are the topics covered, which I programmed in the VM.

- Fundamentals of computer architecture: digital logic design, working up from the logic gate level to  
  understand the function of a simple computer; machine-level programming to understand implementation of  
  high-level languages; performance models of modern computer architectures to enable performance optimization  
  of software; hardware primitives for parallelism and security.
  
1. Representation of information with binary bits (e.g., Unsigned binary, 2's complement)  
2. Combinational design (e.g., truth tables, logic gates, modular design, hierarchical design)  
3. Sequential logic design (e.g., flip-flops, finite state machines)  
4. Computer organization (e.g., register files, ALUs)  
5. Assembly language programming  
6. Input/output strategies for computer architectures  
7. Pipelining (e.g., pipeline stages plus resolving structural, data, and control hazards)  
8. Caches (e.g., block size, associativity, and optimizing code for caches)  
9. Virtual memory and disks  
10. Survey of approaches to parallelization (e.g., SIMD, multi-core, cache coherence)
